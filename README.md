## About Me  
Hi, I'm Ben! I'm a multidisciplinary creator with a passion for crafting engaging digital experiences. My journey spans video editing, motion graphics, and graphic design, and I've recently ventured into web development with a focus on full-stack projects. I'm always eager to learn, create, and solve challenges in innovative ways.

## Projects

### [Druid Video Sales Portal](https://github.com/benMerlotti/Druid_ClipMarketplace)
A secure, client-facing web application built to allow a video production company (Druid) to showcase and sell event footage directly to their clients. This project demonstrates a full-stack development workflow, integrating a modern frontend with a Python backend and leveraging core AWS cloud services for scalable and secure file storage and delivery.
- **Tech Stack**: Python, Flask, React.js, AWS (S3, IAM), Boto3, JavaScript (ES6+), HTML/CSS
- **Key Features**
  - Dynamic S3 Integration: The Flask backend communicates directly with AWS S3 to dynamically list video objects based on a client-specific folder structure (e.g., ClientName/EventName/).
  - Secure, On-the-Fly Access: Implements a secure delivery mechanism by generating time-limited S3 Pre-signed URLs. This allows clients to view private videos without exposing the source files or requiring public bucket access.
  - RESTful API Backend: A Flask-based API serves video metadata to the frontend, acting as a secure intermediary between the client's browser and AWS services.
  - Interactive Frontend: A client-side application built with React that fetches and displays a list of available videos, providing a user-friendly interface for browsing content.
  - Cloud-Native Foundation: Utilizes AWS IAM for creating dedicated service users and fine-grained permission policies, adhering to the principle of least privilege for enhanced security.
- **Learning Focus**: Full-stack application architecture, REST API design and development (Flask), frontend state management (React Hooks), integration with major cloud services (AWS S3), cloud security best practices (IAM roles/users, pre-signed URLs), and managing a multi-service development environment (backend server, frontend dev server, cloud services).

### [Movie Tv Recommender](https://github.com/benMerlotti/Movie-Tv-Recommender)
A content-based movie and TV show recommendation system built in Python. This project demonstrates an end-to-end data pipeline, from data collection via the TMDB API, through data cleaning and preparation, to implementing a recommendation engine using TF-IDF vectorization and cosine similarity.
- **Tech Stack**: Python, scikit-learn, requests, JSON
- **Key Features**:
  - Fetches movie data (overview, genres, keywords, cast, director) from The Movie Database (TMDB) API.
  - Cleans and preprocesses textual data to create a "content soup" for each movie.
  - Utilizes TF-IDF to convert movie content into numerical vectors.
  - Calculates cosine similarity between movies to find similar content.
  - Provides movie recommendations based on a user-supplied movie title via a command-line interface (CLI).
- **Learning Focus**: Data pipeline development, API integration, data cleaning, feature engineering (text processing), content-based filtering, and basic machine learning concepts.

### [Tequio Business Ops Manager](https://github.com/benMerlotti/TequioDemoTrack_Capstone)  
A web application designed to manage customer, employee, product, and purchase data while providing actionable insights and streamlined operations.
- **Tech Stack**: React, .NET, SQL Server
- **Key Features**:  
  - Create and manage customer and employee profiles  
  - Track product inventory and purchase records  
  - Generate and download CSV reports  
  - Responsive design optimized for both mobile and desktop use  


### [FlexTrack](https://github.com/benMerlotti/FlexTrack_Capstone)  
A workout tracker web application designed to help users create and manage routines, track progress, and stay consistent with their fitness goals.  
- **Tech Stack**: React, JSON Server
- **Key Features**:  
  - Create custom workout routines  
  - Track sets, reps, and weights  
  - Responsive design for mobile and desktop  

More projects coming soon!
